            "content": "TTS . TTS can be viewed as a sequence-to-sequence mapping problem; from a sequence of discrete symbols (text) to a real-valued time series (speech signals). A typical TTS pipeline has two parts; 1) text analysis and 2) speech synthesis. The text analysis part typically includes a number of natural language processing (NLP) steps, such as sentence segmentation, word segmentation, text normalization, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion. It takes a word sequence as input and outputs a phoneme sequence with a variety of linguistic contexts. The speech synthesis part takes the context-dependent phoneme sequence as its input and outputs a synthesized speech waveform. . End-to-end TTS . easier pipeline | better peformance | . Wavenet . Based on: . DeepMind&#39;s Wavenet | https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/07/deep-learning-signal-processing.html | https://deepmind.com/blog/article/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio | . Wavenet V1 . before wavenet, ther was two methods: . generative method, which would produce the over all song of the sentece well, but would fail to produce the individual sounds well | concatinative: we use a huge corpus of phonatics and concatinate them together to procude a whole sentence, this way we would procuce the individual sounds correctly, but we would lose the song of the sentence . | wavenet: tries to do both of the above methods, it also can change the speaker by changing some parameters . | data output: 16 khz rate . | we cant use normal RNN as the max seq length around 50 . | they used dilated CNNs: . can have very long look back | fast to train | . | . This paper has presented WaveNet, a deep generative model of audio data that operates directly at the waveform level. WaveNets are autoregressive and combine causal filters with dilated convolutions to allow their receptive fields to grow exponentially with depth, which is important to model the long-range temporal dependencies in audio signals. We have shown how WaveNets can be conditioned on other inputs in a global (e.g. speaker identity) or local way (e.g. linguistic features). When applied to TTS, WaveNets produced samples that outperform the current best TTS systems in subjective naturalness. Finally, WaveNets showed very promising results when applied to music audio modeling and speech recognition. . Wavenet V2 . https://deepmind.com/blog/article/high-fidelity-speech-synthesis-wavenet . They needed to predict time samples in prallel so that wavenet can be used in production, so the used a fully trained wavenet teacher, to train a smeller wavnet student, which doent depend on previous samples to produce the current sample, while still maintaining the same quality . - . End-to-end adversarial TTS . Based on: . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTB2p4bqtXU | https://deepmind.com/research/publications/2020/End-to-End-Adversarial-Text-to-Speech | https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03575 | . Adversarial: means we have a generator and a descriminator which tries to detect which output is generated and which is real End-to-end : they take in text and output the speech . steps: . we enter the text, then we tokenize it | then we use a stack of dilated conv layers to predict the length of each token | with this info, we can predict the center of each token | then we use a gaussian kernel to give a prob distributaion for the place of the token center | then the generator can generate the sound | . ** Q: here we assumed that every token starts directly after the one before it, but is that the case? don&#39;t we need to add a small duration of no sound between tokens? . Tacotron2 . based on: . paper | repo | . you train tacotron-like seq2seq model to output a mel spectrogram, then pass that to wavenet to generate the wave form . This paper describes Tacotron 2, a fully neural TTS system that combines a sequence-to-sequence recurrent network with attention to predicts mel spectrograms with a modified WaveNet vocoder. The resulting system synthesizes speech with Tacotron-level prosody and WaveNet-level audio quality. This system can be trained directly from data without relying on complex feature engineering, and achieves state-of-the-art sound quality close to that of natural human speech. .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon.

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .
