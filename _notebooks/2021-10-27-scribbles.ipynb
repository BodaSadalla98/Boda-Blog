    "#### deduction vs induction:\n",
    "* deduction: is the process of reasoning from one or more general statements to reach a logically certain conclusion. premises must be correct.\n",
    "* induction:  reasoning that construct or evaluates general proposition that are derived from specific examples. we can never be sure our conclusion can be wrong! \n",
    "* machine learning tries to automate the process of inductive inference.  \n",

    "* ML tries to find patterns in data \n",
    "* we will only be able to learn if there's something to learn\n",
    "* ML makes some assumptions, which are are rarely made explicit.\n",
    "* we need to have an idea what we are looking for. This is called \"inductive bias\". Learning is impossible without such a bias\n",

    "* on the other hand, if we have a very strong inductive bias, then with just few training examples, then we can have high certainty in the output\n",

    "* any system that learns has an inductive bias.\n",
    "* if the algorithm works, **THERE HAS TO BE A BIAS**\n",
